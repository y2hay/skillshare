## Skill Creation Process

To create a skill, follow the "Skill Creation Process" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

**For Claude Code plugins:** When building a hooks skill, the analysis shows:
1. Developers repeatedly need to validate hooks.json and test hook scripts
2. `scripts/validate-hook-schema.sh` and `scripts/test-hook.sh` utilities would be helpful
3. `references/patterns.md` for detailed hook patterns to avoid bloating SKILL.md

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Create Skill Structure

For Claude Code plugins, create the skill directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p plugin-name/skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}
touch plugin-name/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Note:** Unlike the generic skill-creator which uses `init_skill.py`, plugin skills are created directly in the plugin's `skills/` directory with a simpler manual structure.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-created or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Also, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. Create only the directories you actually need (references/, examples/, scripts/).

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., "To accomplish X, do Y" rather than "You should do X" or "If you need to do X"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.

**Description (Frontmatter):** Use third-person format with specific trigger phrases:

```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "specific phrase 1", "specific phrase 2", "specific phrase 3". Include exact phrases users would say that should trigger this skill. Be concrete and specific.
version: 0.1.0
---
```

**Good description examples:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", or mentions hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop).
```

**Bad description examples:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when working with hooks.  # Wrong person, vague
description: Load when user needs hook help.  # Not third person
description: Provides hook guidance.  # No trigger phrases
```

To complete SKILL.md body, answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?
2. When should the skill be used? (Include this in frontmatter description with specific triggers)
3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.

**Keep SKILL.md lean:** Target 1,500-2,000 words for the body. Move detailed content to references/:
- Detailed patterns → `references/patterns.md`
- Advanced techniques → `references/advanced.md`
- Migration guides → `references/migration.md`
- API references → `references/api-reference.md`

**Reference resources in SKILL.md:**
```markdown
## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

For detailed patterns and techniques, consult:
- **`references/patterns.md`** - Common patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced use cases

### Example Files

Working examples in `examples/`:
- **`example-script.sh`** - Working example
```

### Step 5: Validate and Test

**For plugin skills, validation is different from generic skills:**

1. **Check structure**: Skill directory in `plugin-name/skills/skill-name/`
2. **Validate SKILL.md**: Has frontmatter with name and description
3. **Check trigger phrases**: Description includes specific user queries
4. **Verify writing style**: Body uses imperative/infinitive form, not second person
5. **Test progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is lean (~1,500-2,000 words), detailed content in references/
6. **Check references**: All referenced files exist
7. **Validate examples**: Examples are complete and correct
8. **Test scripts**: Scripts are executable and work correctly

**Use the skill-reviewer agent:**
```
Ask: "Review my skill and check if it follows best practices"
```

The skill-reviewer agent will check description quality, content organization, and progressive disclosure.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**
1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

**Common improvements:**
- Strengthen trigger phrases in description
- Move long sections from SKILL.md to references/
- Add missing examples or scripts
- Clarify ambiguous instructions
- Add edge case handling
