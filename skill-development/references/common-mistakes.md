## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Weak Trigger Description

❌ **Bad:**
```yaml
description: Provides guidance for working with hooks.
```

**Why bad:** Vague, no specific trigger phrases, not third person

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", or mentions hook events. Provides comprehensive hooks API guidance.
```

**Why good:** Third person, specific phrases, concrete scenarios

### Mistake 2: Too Much in SKILL.md

❌ **Bad:**
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md  (8,000 words - everything in one file)
```

**Why bad:** Bloats context when skill loads, detailed content always loaded

✅ **Good:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md  (1,800 words - core essentials)
└── references/
    ├── patterns.md (2,500 words)
    └── advanced.md (3,700 words)
```

**Why good:** Progressive disclosure, detailed content loaded only when needed

### Mistake 3: Second Person Writing

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
You should start by reading the configuration file.
You need to validate the input.
You can use the grep tool to search.
```

**Why bad:** Second person, not imperative form

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Start by reading the configuration file.
Validate the input before processing.
Use the grep tool to search for patterns.
```

**Why good:** Imperative form, direct instructions

### Mistake 4: Missing Resource References

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

[No mention of references/ or examples/]
```

**Why bad:** Claude doesn't know references exist

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]
